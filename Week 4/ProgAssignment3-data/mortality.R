# nrow function). In addition, you can see the names of each column by typing 
# names(outcome) (the names are also in the PDF document.

# may get a warning about NAs being introduced; that is okay 
# > hist(outcome[,
# 11]) 1 Because we originally read the data in as character (by specifying
# colClasses = "character" we need to coerce the column to be numeric. You may
# get a warning about NAs being introduced but that is okay
